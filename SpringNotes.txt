Spring Framework
	1. What is framework?
	2. What is Spring Framework?
		Java based framework
		a framework of framework
		lightweight framework 
	3. Why Spring Framework?
	4. Spring Architecture
	5. Spring Containers
	6. Dependency Injection
	7. Auto wiring
	8. Collection mapping
	9. Spring JDBC
	10. AOP
	11. Spring MVC
	
For creating basic Spring application 2 dependencies are required
		1. Spring core
		2. Spring context
		
		go to maven repository
		search for these dependencies
	

1. Name 2 IoC Container in Spring	
	Bean Factory
	ApplicationContext
	
2. Name 2 ways of specifying DI	
	Constructor Injection
	Setter Injection
	
3. What type of applications we can develop using Spring?
	Desktop Applications as well as Enterprise Applications
	
	
Dependency Injection	
	when 1 entity is dependent on another entity to complete its definition, we need
	to inject required dependency
	

1. In beans.xml we have constructor injection specified and the class has setter methods 
   and no constructor.
	  Exception in thread "main" org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: 
	  Error creating bean with name 'student1' defined in class path resource [beans.xml]: 
	  Could not resolve matching constructor on bean class [com.springdemo2.beans.Student] 
	  hint: specify index/type/name arguments for simple parameters to avoid type 
	  ambiguities)
	  
2. In beans.xml we have constructor injection specified and the class has setter methods 
   and non parameterized constructor.
	  Exception in thread "main" org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: 
	  Error creating bean with name 'student1' defined in class path resource [beans.xml]: 
	  Could not resolve matching constructor on bean class [com.springdemo2.beans.Student] 
	  hint: specify index/type/name arguments for simple parameters to avoid type 
	  ambiguities)
	  
3. In beans.xml we have setter injection specified and the class has parameterized
   constructor.
	  Exception in thread "main" org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: 
	  Error creating bean with name 'addr1' defined in class path resource [beans.xml]: 
	  Instantiation of bean failed; nested exception is 
	  org.springframework.beans.BeanInstantiationException: 
	  Failed to instantiate [com.springdemo2.beans.Address]: No default constructor found; nested exception is java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: com.springdemo2.beans.Address.<init>()
   
4. In beans.xml we have setter injection specified and the class has setter methods 
   and non parameterized constructor.
	  Exception in thread "main" org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCreationException: 
	  Error creating bean with name 'addr1' defined in class path resource [beans.xml]: 
	  Error setting property values; nested exception is 
	  org.springframework.beans.NotWritablePropertyException: Invalid property 'city' of 
	  bean class [com.springdemo2.beans.Address]: Bean property 'city' is not writable or 
	  has an invalid setter method. Does the parameter type of the setter match the 
	  return type of the getter?
   
5. What if i have both setter methods and constructor in the class. which way of
   dependency injection should be chosen?
	if constructor injection is specified with matching constructor it will work fine 
	without any error.
	if parameterized constructor is in the class and mapping is setter injection then
	object will not be created as non parameterized constructor is not found.
	to resolve this a non parameterized constructor must be added to the class
	then even if both setters and constructor are available the application will work fine.
	

Create following hierarchy in classes and map in the xml file
	Address : city, pincode
	Product : product id, product name, product cost
	Order : order id, product (only 1)
	Customer : customer id, customer name, address, order
